                <p>
                    I am a 26 year old always trying to learn new technologies, skills, and languages. This way I
                    can
                    stay in the forefront of the evolving tech atmosphere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The prospect of making something from nothing is what drives my passion for code and
                    development. I
                    am currently enrolled in the Michigan State University Boot Camp. I've been around computers my
                    whole life, but mainly used them for gaming and exploring the web.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was born and raised in London, England until I moved to the US at 13. Since then I've moved
                    from
                    coast to coast, but have finally set up home in Glendale, AZ.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not working, I am can be found spending time with my wife and our 9 dogs, playing video
                    games, re-watching my favorite trilogy, or reading fantasy novels.
